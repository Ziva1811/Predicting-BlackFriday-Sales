<h1>Predict Black Friday Sales.</h1>

<p>The goal of this project is to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.</p>

## File Description
<ul>
  <li> A descriptive Collab Notebook</li>
  <li> Train and Test data sets</li>
  <li> Cleaned Train and Test data sets</li> 
  <li> Predict.csv which contains predicted purchase of each customer.</li>
  <li> Kaggle.json for downloading data set from kaggle</li>
  </ul>
  

## Result of Analysis

Results and discussion were published on Medium: <a href="https://medium.com/@cplpu1811/predicting-black-friday-sales-in-us-ad4150335cda" > Predicting Black Friday Sales </a>

<p> In this we dive into a real life machine learning project: </p>
<ul> 
  <li>Investigated the train data</li>
  <li>Performed Exploratory Data Ananlysis</li>
  <li>Pre-Processed the data based on feature property</li>
  <li> Build machine leanring model</li>
  <li> Improved the model (Hyperparameter Tuning)</li>
 </ul>
